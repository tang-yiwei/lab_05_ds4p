```

### Exercise 1

There are three Denny's locations in Alaska.

```{r filter_dennys_AK}
dn_ak <- dennys %>%
  filter(state == "AK")
nrow(dn_ak)
```

There are two La Quinta locations in Alaska.

```{r filter_lq_AK}
lq_ak <- laquinta %>%
  filter(state == "AK")
nrow(lq_ak)
```

### Exercise 2

We need to calculate six locations between the two La Quintas and the three Denny's.

```{r calc_pair}
pair <- nrow(lq_ak) * nrow(dn_ak)
```
